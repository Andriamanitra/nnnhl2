# NNNHL 2

no-nonsense nhl schedule & highlights, now with 98% less JS/TS, 100% more backend, and 100% more Rust (compared to the old and now broken [nnnhl](https://github.com/Andriamanitra/nnnhl))

Work in progress!

## notes

API types still missing for:
* [Stats](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/new-api.md#stats) for players, skaters, goalies, teams
* [Rosters](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/new-api.md#rosters)
* [Game details](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/new-api.md#game-details)
* [Player search](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/new-api.md#player-search)

(it would be nice to get them all generated & cleaned up and publish it as a separate crate)
